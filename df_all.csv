The production will be part of a series of five historical operas by Black composers depicting prominent figures of Black liberation and thought across 250 years of history. The company will produce semi-staged concert performances of these works alongside commercial recordings released on BMOP/sound for its next five seasons. Intended Beneficiaries: Intended beneficiaries include artists, Boston Public Schools students, and audience members, as well as listeners of the digital streaming on radio station BMOP/radio.
