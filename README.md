# NEA-Grant-Topic-Modeling
Project to optimize grant writing and increase chances of a successful NEA grant application for an orchestra

This project digs into the kinds of orchestra projects awarded NEA grant money over the past 10 years. It extracts labels from the project descriptions using LDA and LLM NLP techniques, visualizes which types of projects were successful at winning high-amount awards, and identifies the top words in a project description at each funding level. 

The goal of this project is to inform project brainstorming sessions for a local Bay Area orchestra prior to grant writing, and to inform the language choices during the grant writing process after a project is selected.
